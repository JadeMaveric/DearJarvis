Mental well-being has been an overlooked subject in the overall topic of health until pretty recently. Journaling apps are newly gaining popularity, but suffer from poor user experiences. To perform analytics for insight, they ask questions involving mood, work, and life overall, sort of diverging from actually writing a journal entry. On the other hand, note-taking apps like Google Keep already provide a very nice platform to just jot down our feelings but lack the tools to provide insights. When writing a journal, we came to understand that a user wants two main things:
1. A place to just write down feelings, directly write your heart out. Nothing else hindering the flow.
2. An organised manner to look at previous notes, and gain insights from them.

So we decided to build a tool which would scan through your notes and provide insights, and integrate with an already existing note-taking app like Google Keep. This would allow the user to have all of their notes in a single place. Insights could include simple things like:
1. A graph of your mood over time.
2. The things that make you happy, and the things that make you sad.
3. Things you desire to do.
4. Things you need to do.

Our tool, while still not fit for general use, already performs the first two.
